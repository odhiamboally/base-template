# BaseTemplate Agent Instructions

This file is the canonical source of truth and working contract for AI coding tools in this repository. If another tool-specific file conflicts with this one, this file wins and the other file should be updated.

## Start Every Coding Or Debugging Task

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Read `PLAN.md` and `PLAN_EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md` before phase or architecture work.
3. Read the closest relevant docs before changing code:
   - `docs/architecture/feature-folder-convention.md`
   - `docs/architecture/persistence-standards.md`
   - `docs/architecture/saas-multitenancy-strategy.md`
   - `docs/architecture/ui-to-backend-flow.md`
   - `docs/development/environment-configuration-checklist.md`
   - `docs/development/local-platform.md`
   - `docs/development/azure-storage-configuration.md`
   - `docs/development/non-azure-deployment.md`
   - `docs/development/configuration-code-conventions.md`
4. Inspect the existing code before proposing or writing changes.
5. If a convention changes, update this file and the relevant docs in the same PR.

## Project Identity

- Repo: `odhiamboally/base-template`
- Product: BaseTemplate
- Root namespace prefix: `BT`
- Rename a clone with `scripts/rename-template.ps1` before its first run or deployment.
- After protected data has been issued, `DataProtection:ApplicationName` is immutable without an explicit migration or security reset.
- Target framework: `.NET 10`
- Architecture: modular monolith with Clean Architecture boundaries and bounded-context feature folders.
- Current bounded contexts: `IAM`, `Banking`, `HR`, and `Shared`.

## Architecture Rules

- Dependency direction is inward: `Domain <- Application <- Infrastructure/Persistence <- Api/UI`.
- `Domain` must not reference Application, Infrastructure, Persistence, API, or UI.
- `Application` must not reference Infrastructure or Persistence.
- `SharedKernel` must not reference Domain, Infrastructure, or Persistence.
- Infrastructure and Persistence implement contracts; they do not define business policy.
- Keep feature-owned code inside `Features/{Context}/{Feature}` in every layer where that code exists.
- Keep cross-cutting concerns outside feature folders: logging, middleware, generic caching, generic repositories, JSON helpers, base entities, and shared abstractions.

## Backend Conventions

- Use MediatR request/handler flows already established in the repo.
- Commands/queries and handlers should remain feature-owned.
- Each public top-level type must live in its own file named after that type. This applies to classes, records, structs, interfaces, and enums; do not bundle multiple public DTOs, validators, settings POCOs, entities, or helper types in one file.
- Use `AppResponse<T>` for expected business outcomes.
- Throw exceptions only for unexpected or exceptional failures.
- API responses must go through the established response/problem-details pattern.
- Do not leak exception type names, stack traces, provider errors, connection strings, or internal IDs into user-facing messages.
- All user-facing errors from the UI must be sanitized through the shared messaging pattern.
- Provider-specific integration DTOs belong beside the provider adapter. Shared contracts should stay provider-neutral and should not expose Stripe, M-Pesa, Azure, or other provider wire payloads.
- When a capability supports multiple runtime providers per operation, use a router/factory over isolated provider adapters. Do not make one provider adapter understand another provider's DTOs, credentials, or callbacks.
- Application-layer command/query handlers must use bounded-context Unit of Work interfaces (`ISharedUnitOfWork`, `IBankingUnitOfWork`, etc.) for persistence orchestration, not raw `IRepository<T>`. Always call `CompleteAsync` with a `CancellationToken` after write operations.
- Pass `CancellationToken` to all async I/O calls (`ReadAsStringAsync`, `CompleteAsync`, `SaveChangesAsync`, etc.) where the parameter is available.
- Use `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` for case-insensitive comparisons. Reserve `ToUpperInvariant()`/`ToLowerInvariant()` for value normalization (stored keys, wire formats, display strings) — never for equality checks. C# `switch` on normalized strings is acceptable when `StringComparison` is not supported by the expression.

## Persistence Rules

- Every declared `DbSet<T>` entity must have explicit EF configuration.
- Custom persistence context-related types use the project `DB` acronym, for example `IamDBContext`, `DBContextHelper`, and `ITenantFilteredDBContext`; keep Microsoft framework API names unchanged.
- Respect tenant isolation, soft delete, and audit actor conventions.
- `CreatedBy`, `UpdatedBy`, `ActivatedBy`, `DeactivatedBy`, and `DeletedBy` must store stable actor identifiers, not display names or labels such as `DevelopmentSeed`.
- Prefer generic repository methods unless a concrete repository method is persistence-specific.
- Compose queries before materialization. Do not call `ToListAsync` before filters, tenant scope, paging, projection, or security scope are applied.
- Use `Any` for existence checks, not `Count > 0`.
- Use `CountAsync` only when the count is returned, logged, or used for a decision.
- Avoid N+1 query patterns. Batch identifiers and map results in memory.
- Cursor pagination must fetch `pageSize + 1` before trimming.

## Validation, Logging, And Caching

- Add FluentValidation validators for write requests that can accept user input.
- Use source-generated `LoggerMessage` methods; do not add free-form logging in new code paths.
- Every `catch` block must log or deliberately translate the error into an expected result.
- Use `ICachableRequest` for cacheable queries and `ICacheInvalidatorRequest` for commands that invalidate cache.
- Keep cache keys tenant-aware where data is tenant-scoped.

## IAM And Security

- IAM is a core platform capability, not an application-specific feature.
- Administrative endpoints require permission-based authorization, not only `[Authorize]`.
- Admin MFA enforcement is intentional; non-admin MFA can be policy-driven.
- Session lifecycle must expire cleanly, warn before timeout, and avoid stale UI state.
- Blazor tokens use protected browser storage with a circuit-scoped in-memory fallback; do not mirror bearer or refresh tokens into Redis.
- Profile images are private assets. Use API-mediated access, not direct public blob URLs.
- Local secrets belong in `dotnet user-secrets`; production secrets belong in Azure Key Vault/App Service configuration.
- Never commit secrets, connection strings, app passwords, tokens, private keys, or local temp files.

## Frontend Conventions

- Blazor UI talks to the backend API boundary for app flows.
- Use MudBlazor components where practical and keep UI compact, responsive, and consistent.
- Use `wwwroot/css` for app CSS.
- Avoid JavaScript unless Blazor cannot access the browser capability directly.
- Tables should support compact layout, horizontal overflow, pagination/search/filter patterns, and consistent actions.
- Listing pages follow the Customer hierarchy: create actions occupy a separate top-right page action row, shown-count badges occupy the list heading's right edge, and search/filter controls occupy a full-width row below the heading.

## Azure And Configuration

- Every settings POCO must have a matching JSON/config section.
- Parse configurable modes, providers, transports, and strategies once into typed values, then use `switch` branches with fail-fast unsupported-value errors.
- Keep technical configuration enums in the owning layer; reserve Domain enums for business language and invariants.
- Prefer Azure managed identity in deployed Azure environments.
- GitHub Actions authenticates to Azure through OIDC workload identity federation; do not add publish profiles or long-lived Azure client secrets to deployment workflows.
- Use connection strings only for local development or controlled non-managed-identity scenarios.
- Key Vault secret names use double hyphen mapping, for example `Section--Setting`.
- Environment variables use double underscore mapping, for example `Section__Setting`.
- Production email delivery must use approved provider API adapters. Personal mailbox SMTP is not a production path; Mailpit SMTP is local-only capture infrastructure.
- Keep Azure setup notes in `docs/development/azure-storage-configuration.md` and the checklist in `docs/development/environment-configuration-checklist.md`.
- Run application hosts from Visual Studio and local infrastructure through `ops/local/docker-compose.yml`; do not replace or remove Azure production provider configuration when adding local providers.

## Workflow Rules

- Preserve user changes. Do not revert unrelated work.
- Prefer small, focused commits with clear messages.
- When adding or modifying constructor dependencies for core abstractions (like `DbContext`), ensure the dependency injection configurations in the integration tests are also updated to provide those services.
- Before opening or updating a PR, run:
  - `dotnet build src\Backend\Api\BT.Api\BT.Api.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false`
  - `dotnet test tests\BT.Tests.Architecture\BT.Tests.Architecture.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false`
- Azure migrations and deployments are manual-only. Pushes and pull-request merges must not invoke `deploy-azure.yml`; select `app-service`, `aca-acr`, or `aca-ghcr` in its manual dispatch input.
- PRs should explain what changed, why, impact, and checks.
- If a review comment is valid and small, update the same PR branch.
- If a review comment changes scope materially, discuss before expanding the PR.
