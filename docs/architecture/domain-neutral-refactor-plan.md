# StarterTemplate domain neutral refactor plan

Date: 2026-10-06
Status: Planned. Business removal has not started.
Reference baseline: BaseTemplate commit ed3df7d.

## Objective and repository decision

Create StarterTemplate as a new repository. Preserve BaseTemplate as the worked reference for Banking, HR, and cross-context patterns. A clone of StarterTemplate must support independent account administration and adding a POS feature without editing IAM internals.

Keep .NET 10, the modular monolith, Clean Architecture boundaries, bounded-context feature folders, and API-mediated Blazor flows. Do not add a Person/Party framework, new mediator, module loader, or package split during this refactor.

Commit the pending BaseTemplate work and build fixes first. Review the baseline PR before selecting the exact source revision for StarterTemplate. Do not merge or deploy automatically. Start the new repository from a reviewed clean export, excluding Git metadata, ignored files, bin/obj, local secrets, environment dumps, publish settings, and workstation state. Keep an ORIGIN.md with source repository and full source SHA. Never copy user-secrets or production identities into the starter.

Repository owner/visibility and namespace prefix must be settled before remote creation and renaming. Default recommendation: same owner, private initially; choose a dedicated technical prefix during setup. Use the existing rename script and verify it rather than introducing another packaging system now.

## Retention inventory

| Area | Retain | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IAM | Accounts, credentials, roles, permissions, direct grants, activation/invitation, recovery, disabling, sessions, MFA, passkeys, SSO, private avatars | No Customer/Employee/Department or KYC dependency |
| Persistence | Generic repository, UoW/transactions, specifications, audit, soft delete, concurrency, provider support | IAM, Shared, ControlPlane retained contexts only |
| Platform | Logging, tracing, metrics, health, validation, sanitized responses, resilience, tenant-aware caching, feature flags | No business vocabulary required to operate |
| Messaging | Domain/integration events, outbox, retry, failed messages, background execution, notifications | Remove only Banking/HR producers, consumers, templates and registrations |
| UI | Authenticated shell, native authorization, admin users/roles/permissions/menus, shared components, API clients | No business links, default business menus or Department selectors |
| Tenancy | Tenant resolution/isolation, stamp routing, controlled provisioning and audit | Neutral approval; no mandatory business KYC |
| Delivery | Rename tooling, CI, deployment/IaC, local Compose, provider configuration, Data Protection | New repository identity; remove original deployment bindings |

Payments, reporting, mobile and advanced provisioning remain during the first refactor. Decide optional-module packaging separately. Their presence is not evidence of runtime certification.

## Removal and refactor inventory

| File group or integration point | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Features/Banking across Domain, Application, Persistence, Infrastructure, API, SharedKernel, Validation, RCL and Web | Remove Customers, Directors, corporate details, classifications, contracts, CRUD, events, email composers and seeds |
| Features/HR across those layers | Remove Employees, Departments, manager relationships, numbering/sequences, contracts, CRUD, events and seeds |
| Web Components/Pages/Admin/AdminCustomers.razor, AdminEmployees.razor and department page | Remove routes, dialogs, models, services and imports |
| Application Features/Shared/Validation | Remove Create/Update/Delete Customer, Employee and Department validators that live outside their owning folders |
| IAM Users/Entities/AppUser.cs | Remove EmployeeId/CustomerId, linked factories/behaviors and business events; review NationalId, RegistrationNumber, DateOfBirth and HR Gender dependency; keep minimal auth/display/contact data |
| IAM Users/Entities/AppRole.cs and Menus/Entities/MenuItem.cs | Remove DepartmentId and its scope in DTOs, handlers, persistence indexes and UI |
| IAM CreateAppUser and linked grant/revoke/link handlers | Preserve independent account operations; remove Banking/HR UoW dependencies and business lookup requirements |
| Auth responses/mappings, login/refresh/TOTP/OTP/passkey/SSO and Web AuthSession | Remove linked business IDs consistently; retain claims, tokens, sessions and tenant identity |
| IAM user searches/forms/views and profile contracts | Remove business filters, labels, lookups and KYC inputs |
| IAM role enum, PermissionSeed, MenuItemSeed, IamReferenceDataSeed | Remove Employee/Customer defaults and Banking/HR resources/routes; retain extensible role/permission engine and platform permissions |
| DevelopmentIdentitySeeder | Replace named Employee-linked fixtures with configuration-driven bootstrap administrator and neutral test data |
| TenantModulesDialog and module catalog | Remove hard-coded HR/Banking choices; preserve generic module authorization/invalidation |
| ControlPlane TenantStatus, Tenant.ApproveKYC, command/handler/controller/UI/contracts | Introduce neutral approval terminology; preserve authorization and controlled transitions |
| Program.cs, module DI, infrastructure messaging registration, persistence helpers | Remove registrations and imports; verify each import is functional before treating it as a runtime dependency |
| Banking/Hr contexts, factories, UoWs, repositories, migrations | Remove from StarterTemplate only; retain generic persistence tools |
| deploy-azure.yml and non-azure-deploy.yml | Remove HR/Banking bundle generation/execution and connection variables; audit all scripts, IaC and host configuration for the same dependencies |
| Architecture tests, integration fixtures and isolation tests | Remove business fixtures; retain and generalize boundary, caching, migration and tenant-isolation protection |
| AGENTS.md, PLAN.md, strategy, README and architecture/development docs | Replace business reference instructions in StarterTemplate; preserve generic compact-list UX guidance |

Resolve remaining references by code inspection, not global text deletion. Payment CustomerReference is a provider correlation field and must not be deleted merely because its name includes Customer.

## Execution phases and gates

### Phase 0 Preserve and create

- [x] Commit pending work and Fido2 compatibility fixes in BaseTemplate (ed3df7d).
- [ ] Complete baseline PR review and record source revision.
- [ ] Export clean source into a separate StarterTemplate directory and initialize its new repository.
- [ ] Confirm repository visibility and namespace prefix, rename, remove source deployment bindings and document origin.

Gate: BaseTemplate recoverable, new working directory isolated, no copied local secrets or original deployment credentials.

### Phase 1 Independent IAM

- Refactor account creation, profile and administration before deleting business modules.
- Remove business links from every response, request, claim/state mapping and event.
- Preserve activation email, recovery, access revocation, refresh/session termination and audit actors.
- Remove Department scope from roles/menus while retaining tenant/permission/feature/module constraints.
- Rework neutral bootstrap identity and catalog seeds.

Gate: account lifecycle runs with no Banking/HR service dependency. Unauthorized and forbidden paths remain protected. Auth-state and token/session contracts are consistent across all login methods.

### Phase 2 Remove Banking and HR

Delete the inventory above in coherent slices; remove registrations, validators outside feature folders, navigation, templates, business test fixtures and settings together. Retain platform tests that formerly used business entities by replacing fixtures with platform entities or test-only neutral fixtures.

Gate: API and Web build; dependency searches show no active Banking/HR domain dependency; platform authorization, caching and tenant-isolation coverage retained.

### Phase 3 Neutral tenant approval

Change business KYC to administrative approval, with consistent API/UI/event terminology. Keep approval permission, audit actor, controlled provisioning, suspension and active-only routing. Product-specific compliance checks are downstream policy.

Gate: transition, unauthorized, forbidden and tenant routing tests pass; no path provisions or routes an unapproved tenant accidentally.

### Phase 4 Fresh database and delivery baseline

StarterTemplate initially targets fresh databases, not upgrades of deployed BaseTemplate databases. Preserve BaseTemplate migration history. Once the retained model settles, generate clean initial migrations separately for each retained provider-specific context into Features/{Context}/Migrations/{SqlServer|PostgreSql}. Verify design-time factories use provider-compatible fallback configuration.

Align history tables, bundles, workflow execution, connection names, fixtures, health checks and optional provider settings. Rewire repository/environment/OIDC identifiers for the new repository; do not reuse original production targets.

Gate: both providers migrate an empty database; no pending model changes; migration scripts/bundles generate; deployment configuration has no removed-context or original-target dependency. Do not apply to existing databases.

### Phase 5 Starter certification

Run API/Web builds, unit, architecture and SQL Server/PostgreSQL integration tests. Browser/email smoke: bootstrap login, account invite/activation, password recovery, MFA/passkey/SSO where configured, permission changes, forbidden direct URL, logout, disabled user and refresh/session revocation. Verify rename/start using a disposable clean checkout. Add a test-only neutral vertical slice to prove API-to-application-to-persistence flow without shipping a new demonstration business domain.

Gate: a downstream developer can rename, configure, migrate, run, sign in and introduce a POS slice without editing IAM. Document any optional capabilities that were not exercised.

## Existing readiness items

The Fido2 4 migration fixes compilation and options generation; it does not certify real authenticator ceremonies. Current credential uniqueness and user-handle ownership callbacks return true. Before passkeys are declared ready in StarterTemplate, replace them with validated credential ownership/uniqueness checks and cover failure cases. Track malformed input, challenge consumption/replay, user verification and tenant scope in that focused follow-up.

Retain a readiness item for deployment-specific forwarded-header proxy trust. Preserve the existing targeted-review findings note and resolve its operational items separately. Dependency/analyzer warnings and mobile runtime checks must be reported honestly.

## Check commands

- dotnet build src/Backend/Api/BT.Api/BT.Api.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
- dotnet build src/Frontend/Web/BT.UI.Blazor/BT.UI.Blazor.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
- dotnet test tests/BT.Tests.Unit/BT.Tests.Unit.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
- dotnet test tests/BT.Tests.Architecture/BT.Tests.Architecture.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
- dotnet test tests/BT.Tests.Integration/BT.Tests.Integration.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
- git diff --check

Run focused checks per slice and full provider/browser certification at the final gate. Each phase ends in a focused commit/PR with evidence and remaining limits. Do not call the new starter ready based on compilation alone.
