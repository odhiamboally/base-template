# SaaS Multitenancy Strategy

This document defines how BaseTemplate should model SaaS tenancy, deployment isolation, and environment configuration before cloning the template for client products.

## Decision

BaseTemplate uses a hybrid deployment-stamp SaaS model.

- A tenant is a customer organization, business unit, or client workspace served by a product built from BaseTemplate.
- A deployment stamp is an isolated runtime and resource boundary. A stamp can host one tenant or a controlled pool of tenants.
- The same Docker image and codebase can be deployed many times with different stamp-scoped configuration.
- Resource groups, Key Vaults, databases, storage accounts, caches, and messaging resources are provisioned by infrastructure code, not by copying portal settings manually.

This gives us a low-cost pooled path for early tenants and an isolated premium/compliance path for clients that need stronger separation.

## Supported Isolation Tiers

| Tier | Compute | Database | Key Vault | Storage | Cache and messaging | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local development | Visual Studio app hosts plus Docker infrastructure | Local SQL Server | User-secrets and local key ring | Local filesystem or Azurite | Redis, RabbitMQ, Mailpit, Azurite containers | Development and demos |
| Pooled production stamp | Shared container app or app service for a tenant pool | Shared database with tenant filters | Stamp Key Vault | Stamp storage account | Stamp Redis and Service Bus/RabbitMQ | Low-cost tenants with acceptable logical isolation |
| Isolated tenant stamp | Tenant-specific container app or app service | Tenant database or isolated elastic-pool database | Tenant or stamp Key Vault | Tenant or stamp storage account | Tenant or stamp cache and broker | Regulated, premium, noisy-neighbor-sensitive, or custom clients |

Pooled stamps are allowed only when tenant isolation is enforced at the data layer and covered by tests. Isolated stamps are preferred when a client needs physical isolation, custom resources, region-specific hosting, or stricter compliance boundaries.

## Control Plane And Data Plane

BaseTemplate should separate SaaS control-plane concerns from product data-plane concerns.

The control plane owns tenant and deployment metadata:

- Tenant ID, display name, hostnames, status, and isolation tier.
- Deployment stamp ID and target resource group.
- Database provider and connection resolution strategy.
- Key Vault URI and storage/cache/messaging provider choices.
- Feature flags, enabled integrations, and optional add-ons.

The data plane serves normal product traffic:

- Resolves the current tenant from hostname, authenticated claims, or an approved tenant resolver.
- Applies tenant filters and authorization to business data.
- Reads only the stamp-scoped configuration injected into the host.
- Does not know about unrelated tenant resource groups, Key Vaults, or databases.

## Configuration Rules

The application code reads stable configuration sections. The deployment stamp supplies the values.

- Code reads normal .NET keys such as `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`, `CacheSettings:Provider`, and `ProfileImageStorage:Provider`.
- Local development uses `dotnet user-secrets`.
- Azure App Service and Azure Container Apps use environment variables and Key Vault references.
- Key Vault secret names use double hyphen mapping, for example `CacheSettings--Azure--ConnectionString`.
- Environment variables use double underscore mapping, for example `CacheSettings__Azure__ConnectionString`.
- Each isolated stamp can reuse simple secret names because the Key Vault itself is isolated.
- Avoid one shared Key Vault with tenant-prefixed secrets unless we deliberately choose a shared-compute model and have tests proving tenant secret routing cannot cross boundaries.
- Managed identity access must be scoped to the stamp resources the app is allowed to read.

For Azure Container Apps, Bicep or Terraform should inject the stamp-specific environment variables and secret references. The container image must not contain secrets.

## Infrastructure As Code Rules

Do not manually copy resource groups in the portal. Define reusable infrastructure modules and parameter files.

Core modules should cover:

- Resource group or stamp boundary.
- Container registry selection: GHCR, ACR, or another approved registry.
- Container Apps environment or App Service plan.
- API and UI container apps or web apps.
- Managed identities and role assignments.
- Key Vault.
- SQL Server/Azure SQL, with conditional support for other database providers only when the code and migrations are certified for them.
- Storage account and private containers.
- Redis.
- Service Bus or selected broker.
- Application Insights or approved observability sink.

Optional add-on modules should be conditional, for example AI Search, extra storage, per-tenant broker, or a different database provider for a specific client.

## Stamp Authentication Policy

- **Pooled stamps** stay single-app, meaning the Control Plane and Data Plane share the same overarching identity provider configuration (e.g., a shared Entra ID app registration).
- **Isolated and regulated stamps** MUST get a separate ControlPlane auth realm. This requires a distinct Entra ID app registration (or equivalent IdP configuration) per isolated stamp, with a distinct JWT audience.
- Platform staff must structurally never receive a `tenant_id` claim within the isolated realm, ensuring complete structural isolation of identity and preventing token reuse across boundaries.

## Database Strategy

BaseTemplate currently supports the pooled-database model through tenant-scoped entities and global query filters.

Before marking database-per-tenant or PostgreSQL support as production-certified, we must add:

- A tenant catalog and connection resolver.
- Provider-specific EF Core registration.
- Provider-specific migration bundle strategy.
- Automated tests for tenant isolation and migration execution.
- Operational runbooks for backup, restore, and tenant movement.

Do not claim a provider is supported just because infrastructure can provision it. The code, migrations, tests, and deployment workflow must be certified together.

## Deployment Flows

The intended container flow is:

```text
Visual Studio -> GitHub Repo -> GitHub Actions -> Docker image -> GHCR or ACR -> Azure Container Apps
```

The same image can be deployed to multiple stamps:

```text
BaseTemplate API image:v1.2.0 -> aca-tenant-a with Tenant A configuration
BaseTemplate API image:v1.2.0 -> aca-tenant-b with Tenant B configuration
BaseTemplate API image:v1.2.0 -> aca-custom-client with custom provider configuration
```

The registry and deployment target are CI/CD decisions. Runtime provider behavior is configuration. Product behavior is feature flags. Keep these concerns separate.

## Blazor And API Boundary

Blazor remains an API client in this template. It must not own database credentials, Key Vault access, or tenant data isolation policy.

Real-time dashboards should use API-authorized SignalR channels and tenant-aware groups. Do not make dashboard refreshes bypass the API or tenant policy.

## Readiness Gate

SaaS multitenancy is ready when:

- The current tenant can be resolved consistently.
- Tenant-scoped data cannot leak across tenants.
- Stamp-scoped configuration is documented and tested.
- IaC can provision at least one pooled stamp and one isolated stamp shape.
- CI/CD can deploy the same image with different stamp configuration.
- Key Vault, storage, cache, messaging, and database settings are aligned with the selected stamp.

## Middleware Ordering And Tenant Resolution Contract

This section documents a deliberate architectural decision. **Do not change the middleware order without updating this section.**

`TenantResolutionMiddleware` is placed in the pipeline **after `UseRouting()`** and **before `UseAuthentication()`**:

```
UseRouting()
UseMiddleware<TenantResolutionMiddleware>()   ← hostname-based resolution runs here
UseAuthentication()                            ← JWT tenant_id claim is available from here
UseAuthorization()
```

**Why before `UseAuthentication()`?**
Hostname resolution does not require an authenticated user. The middleware resolves the tenant purely from the `Host` HTTP header (or `X-Forwarded-Host` for proxied requests), looks up the matching `Tenant.HostName` in the ControlPlane database (cached for 5 minutes), and injects the resolved tenant ID into a request header.

**Resolution fallback priority in `CurrentTenantProvider`:**
1. `tenant_id` JWT claim (populated post-auth for already-authenticated requests).
2. Request header injected by `TenantResolutionMiddleware` (hostname-derived).
3. `OrgSettings:DefaultTenantId` configuration value (single-stamp deployments).
4. Throws `TenantNotResolvedException` if none of the above resolves.

**Claim vs. header precedence:** JWT claim wins. For isolated stamps, the JWT `tenant_id` claim is the authoritative source. The header is a fallback for anonymous or pre-auth paths.

**Security implication:** If a proxied request arrives with a forged `X-Forwarded-Host`, it could influence hostname-based resolution. Mitigate this by configuring `ForwardedHeadersOptions.KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` to only accept forwarded headers from trusted upstream addresses.

## Tenant Lifecycle States

The tenant lifecycle is modelled as an explicit state machine. **No provisioning occurs unless the KYC gate is explicitly cleared by a Platform Operator.**

| Status | Meaning | Who transitions | Expected Operator Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PendingKYC` | Default on creation. Identity and compliance checks are outstanding. | System (on create) | Operator reviews client documents and calls `POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/approve-kyc` once satisfied. |
| `PendingProvisioning` | KYC cleared. Waiting for operator to trigger infrastructure provisioning. | Operator (approve-kyc) | Operator calls `POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/provision` to dispatch the GitHub Actions stamp workflow. |
| `Provisioning` | Infrastructure is being deployed via GitHub Actions. | System (provision) | Wait for the provisioning workflow to complete, then call `POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/activate`. |
| `ProvisioningFailed` | The GitHub Actions workflow dispatch failed. Infrastructure may not exist. | System (failed dispatch) | Diagnose the failure via GitHub Actions logs. Fix the configuration, then re-trigger via `POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/provision`. |
| `Active` | Fully operational. Tenant traffic is served. | Operator (activate) | None. |
| `Suspended` | Tenant is temporarily blocked. Requests for this tenant will not be served. | Operator | Call `POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/activate` to restore access. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A tenant in any status **other than `Active`** will **not** be resolved by `TenantResolutionMiddleware`. The middleware filters on `TenantStatus.Active` only. This prevents premature data access before KYC clearance and before isolated infrastructure is ready.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never skip the KYC gate** — even for manual internal tenants. A tenant in `PendingKYC` is a holding pen. Routing live traffic to an unverified tenant is a compliance and fraud risk.


## Future Enhancements & MUST DOs

### Self-Service Onboarding Flow (Downstream Implementation)

**Status: OUT OF SCOPE FOR BASE TEMPLATE.**

While a public-facing onboarding flow (registration -> payment via Stripe -> automated tenant provisioning) is common for SaaS products, it is highly specific to the business domain (e.g., InsurHub vs Sacco System). 
Therefore, this base template provides the foundational Tenant State Machine (KYC gate, Pending Provisioning, etc.) but leaves the actual public onboarding endpoints, Stripe integrations, and domain-specific readiness checks to the downstream applications.

When implementing this downstream, keep in mind:
**Auto-provisioning infrastructure immediately upon sign-up is dangerous (fraud, abuse, cost exploitation).** The KYC gate, already built into the Tenant State Machine, is the mechanism that prevents this.

#### Required Flow

```text
Anonymous User
  │
  ▼
Public Registration Page  ──►  POST /api/v1/onboarding/register
  │                             - Creates a User + Tenant (status: PendingKYC)
  │                             - Sends welcome/KYC-pending email
  ▼
KYC Document Submission  ──►   POST /api/v1/onboarding/kyc/submit
  │                             - Stores documents (encrypted, private blob)
  │                             - Notifies Platform Operator
  ▼
Platform Operator Review  ──►  POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/approve-kyc
  │                             - Transitions: PendingKYC → PendingProvisioning
  │                             - Notifies user KYC is approved
  ▼
Stripe Checkout  ──►           POST /api/v1/onboarding/payment/start
  │                             - Creates a Stripe Checkout Session
  │                             - On success webhook: marks payment verified
  ▼
Operator Triggers Provision ►  POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/provision
  │                             - Transitions: PendingProvisioning → Provisioning
  │                             - Dispatches GitHubActionsStampProvisioner
  ▼
Tenant Activated  ──►          POST /api/v1/control-plane/tenants/{id}/activate
                                - Transitions: Provisioning → Active
                                - Sends "Your account is ready" email
```

#### Design Guidance

- **KYC Gate is Mandatory.** Even for internal/test tenants. There is no fast-path that skips `PendingKYC`.
- **Extensible Readiness Checks.** The `Tenant` entity should expose a `ReadinessChecks` value object (e.g., `KycVerified`, `PaymentVerified`, `ContractSigned`) so that new requirements can be added without schema migrations. Use `JSONB` (PostgreSQL) or a separate `TenantReadinessChecks` table (SQL Server) to store these flags.
- **Payment is Optional per Plan.** Not all tenants will require Stripe (e.g., internal enterprise contracts with invoicing). Payment verification should be a configurable check that can be bypassed by Platform Operators for specific plans.
- **Do not provision resources on webhook receipt alone.** Stripe webhooks can be replayed or forged. Provision only after an operator confirms in the Control Panel.
- **Onboarding endpoints are public (no auth required before registration).** They must be rate-limited, CAPTCHA-protected, and behind a WAF rule. Do not use the same controller or route prefix as tenant-scoped API endpoints.

#### Implementation Scope (For Downstream Applications)

- [ ] `PublicOnboardingController` — registration, KYC submission, payment start endpoints.
- [ ] `TenantReadinessChecks` value object / shadow table.
- [ ] Stripe webhook handler (`PaymentVerifiedEventHandler`).
- [ ] KYC document storage (private blob, access via API, never public URLs).
- [ ] Email notifications for each state transition.
- [ ] Blazor public onboarding pages (outside `ControlPlaneLayout`).

### PostgreSQL JSONB Usage

When using PostgreSQL as the primary database provider, the `jsonb` column type is available for storing flexible, schema-less data. Use `jsonb` for:

- **Tenant Readiness Checks** — storing extensible verification flags without requiring a migration per new flag.
- **Feature Flag Payloads** — arbitrary rule payloads for `IFeatureFlagService`.
- **Integration Event Metadata** — storing provider-specific wire payloads as opaque JSON beside the event record.

Do **not** use `jsonb` as a substitute for well-modelled relational data. Use it only for genuinely variable-shape payloads where a strict schema adds more cost than value. EF Core supports `jsonb` via `.HasColumnType("jsonb")` on `string` or `JsonElement` properties.

> [!NOTE]
> `jsonb` is a PostgreSQL-specific feature. If a column uses `jsonb`, the entity configuration must use `#if` guards or separate `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` implementations for SQL Server (use `nvarchar(max)` + `HasConversion<string>`) to maintain dual-provider support.
