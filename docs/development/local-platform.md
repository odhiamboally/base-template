# Local Platform

BaseTemplate runs application code from Visual Studio and runs replaceable infrastructure dependencies in Docker. This preserves normal .NET debugging while making a new developer machine reproducible.

Docker Desktop groups these services under the Compose project name `cg-basetemplate`. The `cg-` prefix identifies the row as a container group rather than an individual service.

Data volumes retain stable `basetemplate_*` names independently of the group label. The setup script creates missing volumes and reuses existing ones, allowing container-group renames and container recreation without abandoning local data.

## Runtime Boundary

Run from Visual Studio:

- `BT.Api`
- `BT.UI.Blazor`
- EF Core migrations and application debugging

Run in Docker:

- RabbitMQ for local MassTransit messaging
- Redis for distributed cache and HybridCache L2
- Mailpit for safe local email capture
- Seq when a locally installed Seq instance is not already available
- Azurite for local Azure Blob-compatible profile-image storage
- SQL Server when a developer does not want to use an installed SQL Server instance
- API and Blazor app containers when testing local deployability instead of Visual Studio debugging

Azure Service Bus is an Azure-managed service and does not run in Docker. The same MassTransit consumers use RabbitMQ locally and Azure Service Bus in Azure by changing `Messaging:Transport` and its provider settings.

## First-Time Setup

Docker Desktop must be running. From the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/setup-local-platform.ps1
```

The script:

1. Generates random local-only RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL Server, and Azurite credentials in ignored `ops/local/.env`.
2. Writes matching RabbitMQ, Redis, and Mailpit provider values to API user-secrets.
3. Pulls and starts RabbitMQ, Redis, Mailpit, and Azurite.
4. Waits for container health checks.

Run the script from the repository root, the folder containing `BaseTemplate.sln`, `AGENTS.md`, and the `scripts` folder:

```powershell
cd path\to\BaseTemplate
./scripts/setup-local-platform.ps1
```

It is a repository script, not a globally installed PowerShell command. You may invoke it from another folder only by supplying its full path.

Optional profiles:

```powershell
# Add Seq when port 5341 is not already used by a local Seq installation.
./scripts/setup-local-platform.ps1 -IncludeSeq

# Add SQL Server on localhost,14333 and update the API connection-string secret.
./scripts/setup-local-platform.ps1 -IncludeSqlServer

# Start every local dependency.
./scripts/setup-local-platform.ps1 -IncludeSqlServer -IncludeSeq
```

Do not use `-IncludeSqlServer` when retaining an existing SQL Server/SSMS database connection. The script leaves the existing `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` secret unchanged unless that switch is supplied.

The setup script is idempotent and can be run whenever Docker services or local user-secrets need to be aligned. It creates credentials only when the ignored `ops/local/.env` file does not exist; later runs reuse those credentials and safely reconcile containers. It is not required before every Visual Studio launch when the containers are already running and the secrets have not changed.

The standard Visual Studio setup selects `ProfileImageStorage:Provider=Azurite`, uses the separate `ProfileImageStorage:Azurite` section with `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`, and targets the private `profile-images` container. The containerized app profile uses the randomly generated `AZURITE_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `AZURITE_ACCOUNT_KEY` values from ignored `ops/local/.env`; no shared emulator key is committed. Filesystem storage remains available as an explicit fallback by selecting `Provider=Local`. The `ProfileImageStorage:AzureBlob` section remains independent and preserved for Azure production.

## Local App Deployment

Use this when you want the local machine to behave like a small deployment target: Docker builds the API and Blazor images, starts them with the same infrastructure dependencies, and injects configuration through environment variables instead of `dotnet user-secrets`.

From the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/setup-local-app-deployment.ps1
```

By default, the app containers expect `APP_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` in ignored `ops/local/.env`. This should point to the SQL Server that containers can reach. For SQL Server installed on the host machine, Docker Desktop exposes the host as `host.docker.internal`, for example:

```text
APP_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=Server=host.docker.internal;Database=BT;User Id=sa;Password=<your-local-password>;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True
```

The SQL password in `APP_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` is not the BaseTemplate sign-in password. The development admin user is seeded from `DevelopmentSeed:AdminEmail` and `DevelopmentSeed:AdminPassword`; by default that is `aamodhiambo@gmail.com` / `Admin@12345`.

If you want a fully containerized stack including SQL Server, run:

```powershell
./scripts/setup-local-app-deployment.ps1 -UseContainerSql
```

The app deployment overlay:

- Builds `BT.Api` from `ops/docker/api.Dockerfile`.
- Builds `BT.UI.Blazor` from `ops/docker/blazor.Dockerfile`.
- Uses RabbitMQ, Redis, Mailpit, and Azurite through Docker service names.
- Sets `DevelopmentSeed:ResetExistingAdminPassword=true` for app containers so stale local Identity password hashes and lockouts can be recovered predictably during Docker smoke tests.
- Stores ASP.NET Core Data Protection keys in Redis using `DataProtection:KeyEncryptionMode=None` for local-only development.
- Keeps Azure Blob, Key Vault, Service Bus, and provider production settings untouched.

If the local Redis volume/key ring is deleted after an authenticator app has been enrolled, previously encrypted TOTP secrets cannot be decrypted. The API treats this as a stale local security artifact: it logs the key-ring failure, disables the stale authenticator enrollment, and asks the user to sign in again and set up the authenticator app. This does not change Visual Studio or cloud behavior; it only protects the local app-deployment flow from exposing Data Protection internals.

If an authenticator enrollment is reset this way, delete the old BaseTemplate account entry from Microsoft Authenticator/Google Authenticator/1Password and scan the new QR code. Old 6-digit codes are tied to the old secret and will remain invalid.

Local Identity lockout is enabled to match production behavior. Five failed password attempts lock the account for five minutes. During local testing, wait for the lockout window to expire or reset the local user row intentionally in the development database; do not keep retrying because each failed password attempt increments the Identity lockout counter.

Default app endpoints:

| App | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| API | `http://localhost:8080` |
| Scalar | `http://localhost:8080/scalar/v1` |
| Blazor UI | `http://localhost:8081` |

The full app deployment is for deployability confidence and local smoke tests. For day-to-day breakpoint debugging, continue running API and Blazor from Visual Studio while keeping the infrastructure containers running.

## Local Endpoints

| Service | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RabbitMQ | `localhost:5672` | AMQP transport |
| RabbitMQ Management | `http://localhost:15672` | Exchanges, queues, consumers, and message rates |
| Redis | `localhost:6380` | HybridCache distributed layer; avoids common existing port `6379` |
| Mailpit | `http://localhost:8025` | Captured email UI |
| Mailpit SMTP | `localhost:1025` | Local-only capture relay used by `EmailSettings:Provider=LocalMailpit` |
| Seq | `http://localhost:5341` | Structured logs, optional profile |
| Azurite Blob | `http://localhost:10000` | Storage emulator, optional profile |
| SQL Server | `localhost,14333` | Containerized database, optional profile |
| Containerized API | `http://localhost:8080` | Optional local deployment profile |
| Containerized Blazor | `http://localhost:8081` | Optional local deployment profile |

## Operations

```powershell
# Inspect service state.
docker compose --env-file ops/local/.env -f ops/local/docker-compose.yml ps

# Stop containers while preserving data volumes.
./scripts/stop-local-platform.ps1

# Include the same optional profiles that were started.
./scripts/stop-local-platform.ps1 -IncludeSeq

# Restart the core platform.
docker compose --env-file ops/local/.env -f ops/local/docker-compose.yml up -d --wait

# Restart the deployable app profile.
docker compose --env-file ops/local/.env -f ops/local/docker-compose.yml -f ops/local/docker-compose.apps.yml --profile apps up -d --wait
```

The repository stop script deliberately exposes no volume-deletion option. It cannot prevent a developer from invoking Docker directly, so do not run `docker compose down -v` unless local RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL, Seq, and Azurite data should be permanently deleted.

## RabbitMQ Outbox Certification

Run the real RabbitMQ round-trip test from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/test-local-messaging.ps1
```

The script reads generated RabbitMQ credentials from the ignored local environment file without printing them, ensures RabbitMQ is healthy, and runs the `ExternalRabbitMq` integration test. The test:

1. Starts MassTransit against the Docker RabbitMQ broker.
2. Publishes a uniquely identified event through the EF Core bus outbox.
3. Commits the SQLite transaction containing the outbox record.
4. Waits for MassTransit's outbox delivery service to publish the event.
5. Verifies a real RabbitMQ consumer receives the same event.
6. Verifies the EF outbox record is drained.

The ordinary integration suite skips this external test when Docker credentials are unavailable. This keeps CI deterministic while the dedicated script certifies the complete local transport path.

## Azure Deployment Gate

The Azure deployment workflow remains committed but is gated by the GitHub repository variable `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ENABLED`.

- Missing, empty, or `false`: pushes to `main` may register the workflow, but the deployment job is skipped. Normal backend, frontend, mobile, full-solution, and architecture CI remain independent.
- `true`: a qualifying push to `main` automatically builds, tests, creates migration bundles, runs migrations, and deploys the API and UI through the protected `production` environment.

Set it in GitHub under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables > New repository variable**. Use the name `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ENABLED` and value `true` only after the Azure subscription, OIDC variables, SQL connection secret, managed identities, and production environment approval are ready.

## Provider Mapping

| Concern | Local | Azure production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Messaging | RabbitMQ | Azure Service Bus |
| Distributed cache | Redis container | Azure Managed Redis using managed identity |
| SQL | Installed SQL Server or SQL container | Azure SQL |
| Email | Mailpit | Approved email API provider, currently `SendGrid` |
| Logs | Seq | Azure Monitor/Application Insights, optionally Seq |
| Profile images | Local filesystem or Azurite | Private Azure Blob Storage |
| Data Protection | Local key ring | Azure Blob key ring encrypted by Key Vault |

The Azure OIDC workflow, migration bundles, App Service deployment jobs, managed-identity configuration, and Key Vault/Blob settings remain in the repository. Local configuration overrides them through `appsettings.Development.json` and user-secrets; it does not replace them.

Development explicitly disables external Data Protection key storage and selects the local Mailpit email provider. Existing Azure Blob/Key Vault URIs and production email provider secrets can remain configured without being contacted by the local runtime.

## Messaging License Decision

BaseTemplate pins MassTransit `8.5.10`, which targets .NET 10 and is published under Apache-2.0. MassTransit v9 is a commercial release and is not used by the reusable template. Revisit this decision deliberately if a future application purchases MassTransit v9 support and features.
