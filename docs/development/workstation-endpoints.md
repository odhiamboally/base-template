# Workstation endpoint allocations

Host endpoints use localhost. Container-to-container connections use service DNS names and container ports.

These include optional services and reserved allocations, not a claim that every service is running. Native PostgreSQL owns 5432. The obsolete standalone ubuntu-sentinel-postgres container was removed on 2026-10-06; its data volume 92588bf47e4922876d8f527f24d33b24d90a5343596396ff621f7f79bb62ea20 is retained for recovery. Native SQL Express currently uses dynamic port 62225.

Run scripts/check-local-endpoints.ps1 before starting another Compose group. It resolves discovered Compose groups including all profiles, checks existing container bindings, host launch ports and duplicate user-secret identities. Supply -ComposeFiles for new groups without existing containers. The BaseTemplate and LlanSacco setup scripts run this check before startup. Native services and future projects require a fresh inventory; allocations are not a permanent workstation-wide reservation.

BaseTemplate and LlanSacco API and Blazor hosts now have separate UserSecretsId values. Restart Visual Studio hosts after this change. The rename script generates new identities for future clones; local secrets must then be provisioned for the clone. Allocate new host ports and independent Compose project/volume names before first startup. Keep DataProtection:ApplicationName unchanged for an existing application.

Updated local secrets match each application's infrastructure. No database volumes were deleted or migrated. Application login and MFA flows still require a browser smoke test.
