# Renaming The Template

Rename a cloned repository before its first application run or deployment:

```powershell
cd E:\Repos\BaseTemplate
.\scripts\rename-template.ps1 -NewName InsurHub -NamespacePrefix IH
```

This produces project and namespace names such as `IH.Domain`, `IH.Application`, and `IH.Api`. `NewName` is the product identity; `NamespacePrefix` is the short technical prefix and is required so the script never guesses an acronym incorrectly.

Use `-WhatIf` first to preview changes. The script updates product-name variants in text files, changes dotted `BT` technical prefixes, handles the known compact `BTApi` local-data path, and renames matching files and folders. It deliberately does not replace every standalone `BT`, because `BT` is also valid unrelated data such as Bhutan's ISO country code. It skips Git metadata, generated build output, logs, dependencies, and `ops/local/.env`.

After the script runs:

1. Review URLs, email sender values, tenant seed data, Azure resource names, and deployment variables.
2. Restore and build the solution.
3. Configure local user-secrets or deployed environment variables.
4. Start the application only after the new identity is final.

## Data Protection Boundary

`DataProtection:ApplicationName` participates in cryptographic purpose chains. The rename script changes it safely only when used before protected data exists. Once cookies, TOTP secrets, trusted-device tokens, or other protected payloads have been issued, do not rename it casually. A later change requires a deliberate compatibility migration or security-state reset.

## Azure Resources

The script updates repository configuration tokens; it does not rename live Azure resources. Supply actual Key Vault, Storage, App Service, SQL, and Service Bus names through deployment variables and environment configuration.

## Independent local configuration

Renaming assigns fresh UserSecretsId values to host projects and updates design-time references. Provision local secrets for the renamed clone; secret contents are not copied. Modern PowerShell uses UUIDv7; Windows PowerShell 5.1 uses a cryptographically random identifier because its runtime lacks that API.

Allocate distinct host ports and Compose project/volume names before starting a clone alongside another application. Run scripts/check-local-endpoints.ps1 with -ComposeFiles pointing to its Compose file; see [workstation endpoint allocations](workstation-endpoints.md).
