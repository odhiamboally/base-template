# Azure CI/CD Configuration

This guide configures the BaseTemplate GitHub Actions deployment pipeline to use Microsoft Entra workload identity federation (OIDC). GitHub receives short-lived Azure credentials for each workflow run; no client secret or App Service publish profile is stored in GitHub.

## Identity Boundaries

BaseTemplate deliberately uses two identities:

- **GitHub deployment identity:** runs EF migration bundles, manages the temporary Azure SQL firewall rule, and deploys the API/UI packages.
- **App Service managed identity:** is used by the deployed application at runtime for Key Vault, Blob Storage, Redis, SQL, and other Azure services.

Do not assume the App Service managed identity is available on a GitHub-hosted runner. It is scoped to the App Service resource.

## 1. Create The GitHub Deployment Identity

In the Azure portal:

1. Open **Microsoft Entra ID**.
2. Open **App registrations** and select **New registration**.
3. Name it, for example, `github-basetemplate-production`.
4. Leave the redirect URI empty and complete the registration.
5. Record the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.
6. Open **Certificates & secrets** -> **Federated credentials** -> **Add credential**.
7. Choose **GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources**.
8. Select the repository owner and repository.
9. Set **Entity type** to `Environment`.
10. Set the environment name to `production`.

The environment name must match `environment: production` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## 2. Assign Azure RBAC Roles

Assign the deployment identity only the roles needed by the workflow:

- On each target App Service: `Website Contributor`.
- On the Azure SQL logical server: `SQL Server Contributor` so the workflow can create and remove its temporary firewall rule.
- If package deployment needs access to other deployment resources, grant the narrowest resource-scoped role that satisfies it.

Avoid subscription-wide `Contributor` unless it is a temporary bootstrap measure.

## 3. Create The Azure SQL Database User

Configure a Microsoft Entra administrator for the Azure SQL logical server, then connect to the target database using that administrator and run:

```sql
CREATE USER [github-basetemplate-production] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
ALTER ROLE db_ddladmin ADD MEMBER [github-basetemplate-production];
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [github-basetemplate-production];
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [github-basetemplate-production];
```

The user name normally matches the app registration display name. If duplicate display names exist in the tenant, use the Azure SQL `WITH OBJECT_ID` form supported by your server version or rename the registration to a unique value.

`db_ddladmin`, `db_datareader`, and `db_datawriter` are the baseline migration permissions. Review generated migrations before release and tighten permissions further if organizational policy requires a custom migration role.

## 4. Configure The GitHub Environment

In GitHub, open **Settings** -> **Environments** -> **production**.

Add these environment variables:

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Application client ID | OIDC deployment identity |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Entra tenant ID | OIDC tenant |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure subscription ID | Deployment subscription |
| `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` | `rg-basetemplate-prod` | Resource group containing Azure SQL |
| `AZURE_SQL_SERVER_NAME` | `bt-prod-sqlserver` | SQL logical server name without `.database.windows.net` |
| `AZURE_SQL_NETWORK_MODE` | `PublicRunner` | `PublicRunner` or `PrivateRunner` migration networking strategy |
| `AZURE_API_APP_NAME` | `base-template-api-dev` | Exact API App Service resource name |
| `AZURE_UI_APP_NAME` | `base-template-web-dev` | Exact UI App Service resource name |

Add this environment secret:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` | Passwordless Azure SQL connection string shown below |

Recommended connection string:

```text
Server=tcp:<sql-server>.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=<database>;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;Authentication=Active Directory Default;
```

The connection string contains no password. `azure/login@v2` establishes the GitHub identity, and `DefaultAzureCredential` resolves the Azure CLI credential created by that login.

Add required reviewers to the `production` environment if deployment approval is required.

## 5. Azure SQL Networking

The workflow supports two explicit networking modes:

- `PublicRunner`: GitHub-hosted runner using a temporary `/32` Azure SQL firewall rule.
- `PrivateRunner`: self-hosted runner with private network access; no firewall rule is created.

In `PublicRunner` mode the workflow:

1. Discovering the GitHub runner's public IP.
2. Creating a narrowly scoped temporary server firewall rule.
3. Running all four migration bundles.
4. Removing the firewall rule with `if: always()`.

The deployment identity therefore needs `SQL Server Contributor` on the logical server.

For a private-endpoint-only production architecture, replace the GitHub-hosted migration job with a self-hosted runner inside the Azure virtual network. Do not enable broad public access merely to make CI pass.

## 6. Migration Bundle Behavior

The workflow:

- Builds self-contained Linux migration bundles for IAM, HR, Shared, and Banking.
- Passes the Azure SQL connection string explicitly to each bundle.
- Exposes that same secret through the context-specific `ConnectionStrings__*` environment keys. EF constructs each design-time `DbContext` before processing the bundle's `--connection` override, so both forms are required.
- Retries bundle execution while a serverless Azure SQL database resumes.
- Fails immediately when a bundle reports a deterministic missing-connection configuration error instead of treating it as an Azure SQL wake-up delay.
- Uses a separate migrations history table for each context:
  - `__EFMigrationsHistory_IAM`
  - `__EFMigrationsHistory_HR`
  - `__EFMigrationsHistory_Shared`
  - `__EFMigrationsHistory_Banking`

Migration retries are safe because EF migration bundles are idempotent with respect to their migrations history table. Generated migrations must still be reviewed for operations that are not transaction-safe.

## 7. Deployment Behavior

The API and UI deployment jobs authenticate independently with OIDC because each GitHub job runs on a fresh runner. `azure/webapps-deploy@v3` then deploys to the App Service names supplied by GitHub environment variables.

The old publish-profile secrets are no longer required:

- `AZURE_API_PUBLISH_PROFILE`
- `AZURE_UI_PUBLISH_PROFILE`

Remove them after the first successful OIDC deployment.

## Troubleshooting

- `DefaultAzureCredential failed`: confirm `azure/login@v2` succeeded and the federated credential subject targets the `production` GitHub environment.
- `Login failed for user <token-identified principal>`: create the deployment identity as a contained user in the target Azure SQL database and grant migration roles.
- SQL error `40613`: the database is unavailable or resuming. The workflow retries; inspect Azure SQL status if all retries fail.
- Azure SQL Free Limit databases enforce auto-pause and do not allow `AutoPauseDelay=-1`. Keep migration retries for this tier. Move a real production workload to a paid always-on/serverless configuration when cold-start latency is unacceptable.
- SQL firewall denial: confirm public network access is enabled for this workflow model and that the deployment identity has `SQL Server Contributor`.
- `A valid connection string was not found`: confirm the migration step maps `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` to `ConnectionStrings__IamConnection`, `ConnectionStrings__HrConnection`, `ConnectionStrings__SharedConnection`, `ConnectionStrings__BankingConnection`, and `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`. The explicit `--connection` argument alone is not available early enough for design-time context construction.
- `Resource ... not found` during deployment: verify `AZURE_API_APP_NAME`, `AZURE_UI_APP_NAME`, subscription, and tenant values.
- OIDC subject mismatch: the federated credential must target environment `production`, not a branch subject, because the workflow jobs use a GitHub environment.
