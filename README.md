# BaseTemplate

BaseTemplate is a reusable enterprise .NET template for building production-minded systems from a modular monolith starting point.

It is designed to be cloned, renamed, configured, and extended into a real application without redoing the core plumbing every time.

## What Is Included

- `.NET 10` backend with Clean Architecture boundaries.
- Modular monolith structure with bounded-context feature folders.
- Current bounded contexts: `IAM`, `Banking`, `HR`, and `Shared`.
- API, Blazor Web UI, shared Razor Class Library, MAUI shell, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, Persistence, and SharedKernel projects.
- IAM/Auth baseline with local accounts, JWT/cookie-compatible flows, refresh tokens, MFA/TOTP, sessions, lockout, permission authorization, grant/revoke access, profile image upload, and inactivity handling.
- EF Core persistence with per-context `DBContext` types, tenant filters, soft delete, audit stamping, explicit configurations, repositories, unit of work, and migration bundles.
- MassTransit with EF outbox, RabbitMQ local transport, and Azure Service Bus production transport configuration.
- Local Docker platform for RabbitMQ, Redis, Mailpit, Azurite, optional Seq, and optional SQL Server.
- Output caching, response compression, rate limiting, health checks, feature flags, SignalR baseline, QuestPDF reporting abstraction, and payment gateway abstraction.
- Architecture tests and naming/convention guardrails that run in CI.

## Clone And Rename

Rename a cloned repository before its first application run or deployment:

```powershell
cd E:\Repos\BaseTemplate
.\scripts\rename-template.ps1 -NewName InsurHub -NamespacePrefix IH
```

This produces names such as `IH.Domain`, `IH.Application`, and `IH.Api`.

Use `-WhatIf` first to preview changes:

```powershell
.\scripts\rename-template.ps1 -NewName InsurHub -NamespacePrefix IH -WhatIf
```

Read [Renaming the template](docs/development/renaming-the-template.md) before cloning for a real product, especially the `DataProtection:ApplicationName` warning.

## Local Development Quick Start

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. Run the local platform setup from the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-local-platform.ps1
```

3. Configure SQL Server connection and required secrets with `dotnet user-secrets`.
4. Run `BT.Api` and `BT.UI.Blazor` from Visual Studio.
5. Open Mailpit at `http://localhost:8025` to inspect captured local emails.

The local setup uses:

- RabbitMQ for messaging.
- Redis for distributed cache.
- Mailpit for email capture.
- Azurite for Blob-compatible profile image storage.
- Local SQL Server or optional SQL Server container.

See [Local Platform](docs/development/local-platform.md) and [Environment Configuration Checklist](docs/development/environment-configuration-checklist.md).

## Verification

Before opening a PR, run:

```powershell
dotnet build src\Backend\Api\BT.Api\BT.Api.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
dotnet test tests\BT.Tests.Architecture\BT.Tests.Architecture.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
```

Useful additional checks:

```powershell
dotnet test tests\BT.Tests.Unit\BT.Tests.Unit.csproj --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
.\scripts\test-local-messaging.ps1
```

## Azure And Production Configuration

Azure deployment support is present but intentionally gated.

- Keep local development on user-secrets plus Docker services.
- Keep production secrets in Azure Key Vault or App Service settings.
- Prefer managed identity for Azure Blob, Key Vault, Redis, and App Service integration.
- Enable deployment only when the GitHub repository variable `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ENABLED` is set to `true`.

## Clone Readiness

BaseTemplate is reusable now for local-first application development when you:

1. Clone and rename before first run.
2. Configure local secrets and SQL.
3. Run the local Docker platform.
4. Keep product-specific modules outside the base template until cloned.

Some provider-dependent capabilities still need environment-specific certification in the target application:

- Entra ID AppUser linking flow.
- Passkeys/WebAuthn.
- Real Stripe/M-Pesa credentials, callbacks, idempotency, and reconciliation.
- Azure Service Bus smoke test.
- Azure deployment smoke test after a valid Azure subscription is available.

These are tracked in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md), so downstream projects can decide whether to complete them in the template first or activate them after cloning.
